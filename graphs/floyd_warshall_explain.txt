when doing for next intermediate node....why dont u calculate from original matrix instead of updated values of previous iteration???

NEXT
maybe the shortest path exists at a later node?? like instead of 0-->1--->2 it is o--->2-->1
then??

That's a great question! In the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm, the way we handle intermediate nodes ensures that all possible paths between any two nodes, including paths that involve later intermediate nodes, are considered. Let's break down how the algorithm works and why it will still find the shortest path even if the shortest path uses a later node.

Example:
Let's take a simple graph where you want to check the shortest path from 0 to 2. As you suggested, it might be something like 0 -> 2 -> 1 instead of 0 -> 1 -> 2.

Suppose this is the graph:

markdown
Copy code
    0
   / \
  1   2
Edge weights:
0 -> 1: weight = 10
0 -> 2: weight = 5
2 -> 1: weight = 3
Initial Distance Matrix:
We initialize the distance matrix using the direct edge weights between the nodes. If there is no direct edge, we set the distance to infinity (INF).

From	0	1	2
0	0	10	5
1	INF	0	INF
2	INF	3	0
Now, let's run the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm.

First Iteration (k = 0):
In this iteration, we check if any path can be improved by going through node 0:

dist[1][2]: There is no edge between 1 and 2, and going through node 0 won’t improve the distance because there's no direct path from 1 to 0 or 2 through 0. So, no change.
dist[2][1]: It's already 3, so no improvement is needed.
dist[0][1]: It’s 10, but there’s no improvement through 0.
dist[0][2]: It’s 5, no improvement is needed.
The distance matrix after the first iteration remains the same.

Second Iteration (k = 1):
Now we check if any path can be improved by going through node 1. However, since the only edge going out from 1 is INF, no improvements are possible.

The matrix still remains the same.

Third Iteration (k = 2):
Now we check if any path can be improved by going through node 2. Here's where we get the improvement:

dist[0][1]: Initially, it was 10. But going through node 2, we get dist[0][1] = min(10, dist[0][2] + dist[2][1]) = min(10, 5 + 3) = 8. Update made.

dist[1][2] and other values stay the same.

Updated Distance Matrix (after k = 2):
From	0	1	2
0	0	8	5
1	INF	0	INF
2	INF	3	0
Key Observation:
In this iteration, the shortest path from 0 -> 1 through 2 was found (i.e., 0 -> 2 -> 1). This was only discovered in the third iteration when node 2 was considered as an intermediate node.

Why Does This Work?
The algorithm guarantees that by the end of all V iterations, the shortest path between every pair of nodes is discovered, no matter how many intermediate nodes are involved.

The shortest path might involve using later intermediate nodes (like 0 -> 2 -> 1).
When processing node 2 as an intermediate node, we used the best distances found so far (e.g., the shortest path from 0 -> 2 was already found in previous iterations).
In the final iteration when k = 2, we are essentially asking: can we improve any path if we allow node 2 as an intermediate step? The algorithm efficiently considers all combinations of paths in this manner.

Why Don’t We Use the Original Values?
The reason we don’t use the original distance matrix is that we need the best known distances found so far at every step. This ensures that when we consider later intermediate nodes (like 2 in this case), the algorithm already knows the shortest paths that involve earlier intermediate nodes.

If we used the original values (i.e., without updating the matrix after each intermediate node), we would miss crucial updates like the one where the shortest path from 0 to 1 through 2 was found.

Summary:
The Floyd-Warshall Algorithm works by updating the distances progressively through intermediate nodes.
It correctly handles cases where the shortest path involves later intermediate nodes.
We use the updated distance matrix because it reflects the shortest paths discovered so far. If we didn’t, we would miss opportunities to find better paths through multiple intermediate nodes.
Even if the shortest path is 0 -> 2 -> 1, it will be discovered as long as 2 is eventually considered as an intermediate node.
